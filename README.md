## Data Flow (API â†’ services â†’ store â†’ UI)

This app includes a typed service layer and Redux Toolkit store to fetch and render employee activities, team sales, and reports.

### Services
- `src/api/client.ts`: Axios wrapper injecting Bearer token and handling 401 (dispatches logout) and single retry on network/5xx.
- `src/services/EmployeeService.ts`: `getActivities(employeeId)`, `submitActivity(payload)`.
- `src/services/AdminService.ts`: `getTeamSales(teamId)`.
- `src/services/ReportService.ts`: `getReports(start, end)`.

### Store
- `src/store/index.ts`: configureStore with `auth`, `employee`, `admin` reducers.
- `src/store/slices/authSlice.ts`: minimal token+role with `setCredentials`, `logout`.
- `src/store/slices/employeeSlice.ts`, `adminSlice.ts`: async thunks, loading/error states, selectors.

### UI examples
- `src/screens/EmployeeDashboard.tsx`, `src/screens/AdminDashboard.tsx` use store selectors and render minimal cards with loading/empty/error states.

### Mock data
Small fixtures in `src/fixtures/mockData.ts` for local demos/tests.

### Setup
```bash
npm install
npm run start
```

### Tests
```bash
npm run test
```

Jest tests in `__tests__/services/*.test.ts` mock axios and cover success/error paths.

# Welcome to your Expo app ðŸ‘‹

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.
